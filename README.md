# Introduction

Project DocOnCall provides an opportunity for Software Engineering students and Information Security students to work together and experience the secure software development life cycle. DocOnCall is developed for patients to manage their account and call a portable doctor directly to the doorstep to seek non-emergency treatment. This flexible and low overhead arrangement allows qualified doctors to provide affordable treatment without the added cost of running a brick-and-mortar clinic, which offloads a substantial amount of work from the public clinics. In addition to the cheaper treatment cost, the application also provides convenience by eliminating the need for patients to physically go down to the clinic and the hassle of queuing for consultation.
